# AiAnchor Webhook Service

A minimal local service that replicates the n8n flow for AiAnchor booking requests. This service receives webhook payloads, logs them to JSON files, and sends transactional emails via SMTP.

## Features

- âœ… Express.js webhook endpoint
- âœ… JSON payload logging with sanitized filenames
- âœ… SMTP email sending via Nodemailer
- âœ… Rate limiting (60 requests/minute per IP)
- âœ… Input validation and error handling
- âœ… Health check endpoint
- âœ… CORS support
- âœ… Request logging with Morgan
- âœ… Environment-based configuration

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration (defaults work for local development with Mailhog).

### 3. Start Mailhog (for local email testing)

```bash
docker run --rm -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 mailhog/mailhog
```

- SMTP server: `localhost:1025`
- Web UI: `http://localhost:8025`

### 4. Start the Service

```bash
# Development (with auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

The service will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Endpoints

## Logging

Each webhook request is logged to `./logs/{timestamp}-{email}.json` with:
- Request timestamp
- Full payload
- Client IP
- User agent

## Production Setup

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `SMTP_PASS`: Your Zoho app password
   - All other variables are pre-configured
4. Deploy automatically

### Option 2: Render
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Use the included `render.yaml` configuration
3. Set `SMTP_PASS` environment variable
4. Deploy

### Option 3: VPS/Server
1. Upload files to your server
2. Run `npm install --production`
3. Set up PM2: `pm2 start server.js --name webhook`
4. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
WEBHOOK_PATH=4d0fe820-6feb-4aeb-96b6-1b980dcf7b83
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.eu
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=info@aianchor.online
SMTP_PASS=YOUR_ZOHO_APP_PASSWORD
FROM_EMAIL=info@aianchor.online
TEAM_REPLYTO=info@aianchor.com
SMTP_DEBUG=false
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_ZOHO_APP_PASSWORD` with your actual Zoho app-specific password.

## Docker Compose (Optional)

Use the included `docker-compose.yml` for easy local development:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This starts both Mailhog and the webhook service.
